    "Prior to May 25, 2020, COVID-19 deaths in the United States were falling precipitously. On May 25th, that descent slowed dramatically, and then, around the beginning of July, reversed itself, starting a second wave of COVID-19 deaths in the United States. The number of deaths in this second wave, 125K, now exceeds that of the first wave, 100K.\n",
    "\n",
    "The date, May 25, 2020, is significant in that it is the date on which George Floyd died while in police custody in Minneapolis, MN. Subsequent to Floyd's death, protests occurred in over 2,000 cities in the United States. It has been suggested that the George Floyd Protests might have contributed to triggering the second wave of COVID-19. \n",
    "\n",
    "This \"hypothesis\" is confounded, however, by summer political campaigning in the run up to the 2020 Elections. In particular, President Trump was notable for holding campaign rallies in which the president did not follow normative behavior to control COVID-19 infections and neither did many of the rally attendees--possibly following the president's lead. These became known as _super-spreader rallies_. Some news agencies have reported that COVID-19 infections spiked in the areas where these rallies had been recently held. However, I have not found a _systematic_ investigation of whether and to what extent the rallies were correlated with COVID-19 spread."

    "One unknown is that Trump's rallies were not always held in an urban center. For example, some were held at airports. The president would fly in, speak at a rally at the airport, and then fly out. **In these cases, it is not certain where the attendees originated from; that is, we can't assume that they came from the nearest urban center.** \n",
    "\n",
    "To take an example, on September 3, 2020, Trump spoke at a rally at Arnold Palmer Regional Airport outside Latrobe, PA. However, we can't necessarily infer from this that all the attendees were from Latrobe; they might have traveled in from out of area. More importantly, we don't know where the attendees traveled _to_ after the rally. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Actually, this issue, that attendees might reside outside the area where the rally was held, applies to some degree even for rallies held inside city centers.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Another unknown is that the locations of Trump's rallies are not uniformly distributed across the United States.** This could be for reasons such as campaign strategy. But in any case, regional differences between areas that hosted the rallies and those that didn't could introduce bias into the data."
