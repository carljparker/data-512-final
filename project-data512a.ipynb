    "Prior to May 25, 2020, COVID-19 deaths in the United States were falling precipitously. On May 25th, that descent slowed dramatically, and then, around the beginning of July, reversed itself, starting a second wave of COVID-19 deaths in the United States. The number of deaths in this second wave, 125K, now exceeds that of the first wave, 100K.\n",

Subsequent to Floyd's death, protests occurred in over 2,000 cities in the United States. It has been suggested that the George Floyd Protests might have contributed to triggering the second wave of COVID-19. \n",
    "\n",
    "This \"hypothesis\" is confounded, however, by summer political campaigning in the run up to the 2020 Elections. In particular, President Trump was notable for holding campaign rallies in which the president did not follow normative behavior to control COVID-19 infections and neither did many of the rally attendees--possibly following the president's lead. These became known as _super-spreader rallies_. "

    "Early feedback questioned measuring deaths vs infections aka \"cases\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A _**case**_ is typically defined simply as a positive test result. Therefore, the term _case_ is a bit misleading in that it _seems_ to imply that someone is sick, but actually it doesn't imply that someone is symptomatic or that they are contagious or even that they are recently infected. An individual could have been infected by COVID-19 months earlier, been mostly (or perhaps completely) asymptomatic and therefore not even know that they were infected. Much later, they are tested and show up as positive. The irony of such cases is that not only is the individual not a danger to others, they actually make the community safer by virtue of their immunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, measuring deaths is not without issues either. The main issue is that there might be a significant interval between when an individual is infected by COVID-19 and when they die. For the purposes of this project--in which I am trying to measure the contribution of President Trump's rallies to the spread of the virus--if I measure deaths inside a relatively short interval after the rally then I risk not capturing those deaths that haven't yet occurred. On the other hand, if I extend the interval, I risk that the deaths that I capture in the data might actually have been caused by viral spread from other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "All that said, I chose to measure deaths rather than cases. In addition to the factors above, I chose deaths because, in the final analysis, it is the outcome that we care most about. If people only became infected with COVID-19, but never died, the current pandemic would probably have much less urgency."

    "- **We don’t know how many people were at each rally.** There could be a lot of variability there, and the number of people at the rally is (almost certainly) an important factor in how many people contract the virus at the rally and therefore how much the virus could spread in the aftermath of the rally.\n",
    "- **We don’t know if the people who attended a rally resided in the county where the rally was held.** They might have traveled there and then gone back home afterwards . . . and infected people in their home county. The subsequent deaths would then show up in that county rather than the one in which the rally was held. \n",
    "- **Trump's rallies are not uniformly distributed across the United States.** This could be for reasons such as campaign strategy. But in any case, regional differences between areas that hosted the rallies and those that didn't could introduce bias into the data. These differences could include local and state policies with respect to behaviors, such as masking, that affect the spread of COVID-19. Also, on a more subtle level, regional differences in culture could also affect viral spread. Some areas, irrespective of official policies, might be more or less likely to spread the vius. For example, the culture in Seattle, WA has a reputation for being somewhat insular. Early in the pandemic, the (relatively) slow community spread in Seattle was attributed to this cultural characteristic."

    "The study investigated 18 rallies between June 20, 2020 and September 22, 2020. It uses COVID-19 case data from the Johns-Hopkins data respository. It analyzes the data for the county where each rally was held for the ten weeks following the rally. It compares the number of cases during this period with number of cases in a \"placebo\" county that did not host a Trump rally. The study estimate that the 18 Trump rallies resulted in more than 30,000 incremental cases of COVID-19 and 700 deaths. \n",

    "- Both the Stanford study and the current study use data from the Johns-Hopkins data repository.\n",
    "- The Stanford study uses **case data**; the current study uses **mortality data (deaths)**. \n",
    "- The Stanford study tracks COVID-19 cases for the **ten weeks** following each rally; the curent study tracks deaths for the **six weeks** following each rally\n",
    "- The Stanford study's estimate of 700 deaths is based on the _death rate_ for the county in question. It is not clear why the Stanford study didn't directly use the mortality data from Johns-Hopkins.\n",
    "- Although the Stanford study compares the Trump-rally counties to placebo counties, it doesn't provide the names of the placebo counties. Therefore, reproducibility of the Stanford study is hindered.\n",
    "- For the current study, I also considered comparing to a set of _control counties_. However, selecting a set of such counties turned out to be remarkably fraught; so instead, I settled on a much simpler methodology. It is dissapointing that the Stanford researchers do not provide their placebo counties or their criteria for selecting them."
