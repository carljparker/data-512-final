# Intro #

Hi, this is Carl Parker and I'm going to be speaking about the possible
impact of President Trump's campaign rallies on the spread of the
COVID-19 virus.


# Background #

Prior to Memorial Day, the number of deaths from COVID-19 in the United
States was dropping precipitously. At that rate of decline, COVID-19
would have reached zero in the US in less than a month. 

However, shortly after Memorial Day, the rate of decline first
decelerated and then began to climb, peaking on ----.

There has been some speculation that this surge is attributable to the
political protests that occurred during the summer in the aftermath of
George Floyds death while in police custody. 

However, my brother suggested that an alternative explanation could be
President Trump's campaign rallies which occurred throughout the summer
and early fall. 


# The Rallies #

Trump held 67 rallies in 64 different cities across 14 states. The
rallies occurred between June 20th and November 2nd.

- Arizona
- Florida
- Georgia
- Iowa
- Michigan
- Minnesota
- Nevada
- Nebraska
- New Hamshire
- North Carolina
- Ohio
- Oklahoma
- Pennsylvania
- Wisconsin


# The Data #

For COVID-19, I used data from the Johns-Hopkins COVID-19 repository on
GitHub. This repository is updated daily and aggregates data globally at
the country level and within the United States at the level of
individual counties.

For information about President Trump's rallies, I used Wikipedia which,
remarkably, has a list of documented dates and locations of all of
Trump's rallies.


# Caveats #

- We don't know how many people were at each rally. 
- We don't know to what extent the people who attended the rallies
  resided there in the county where the rally was held or traveled there
  from out of area in order to attend the rally.
- We don't know to what extent any spread can be attributed to the rally
  versus locale or state policies with respect to containing COVID-19
  spread.


# Findings #

Having said all of that, let's look at the numbers themselves.
