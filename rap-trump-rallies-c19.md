# Intro #

Hi, this is Carl Parker and I'm going to be speaking about the possible
impact of President Trump's 2020 campaign rallies on the spread of the
COVID-19 virus.


# Background #

Prior to Memorial Day, the seven-day moving average of deaths from
COVID-19 in the United States was dropping rapidly. However, shortly
after Memorial Day, the rate of decline decelerated and then began to
climb, peaking on August 1st.

I want to explore the question of whether this second wave of COVID-19
was contributed to by Trump's campaign rallies which occurred throughout
the summer and fall of 2020. 

President Trump developed a reputation for not adhering to recommended
norms with respect to COVID-19. For example, people who attended his
rallies often did not socially distance or wear masks. President Trump
himself usually did not wear a mask.


# The Rallies #

Trump held 67 rallies in 64 different cities across 14 states. The
rallies occurred between June 20th and November 2nd.

- Arizona
- Florida
- Georgia
- Iowa
- Michigan
- Minnesota
- Nevada
- Nebraska
- New Hamshire
- North Carolina
- Ohio
- Oklahoma
- Pennsylvania
- Wisconsin


# The Data #

For COVID-19, I used data from the Johns-Hopkins COVID-19 repository on
GitHub. This repository is updated daily and aggregates data globally at
the country level and within the United States at the level of
individual counties.

For information about President Trump's rallies, I used Wikipedia which,
remarkably, has a list of documented dates and locations of all of
Trump's rallies.


# Caveats #

- We don't know how many people were at each rally. 
- We don't know to what extent the people who attended the rallies
  resided there in the county where the rally was held or traveled there
  from out of area in order to attend the rally.
- We don't know to what extent any spread can be attributed to the rally
  versus locale or state policies with respect to containing COVID-19
  spread.


# Findings #

Having said all of that, let's look at the numbers themselves.

This is a histogram that shows the distribution of the percentage change
in deaths after each rally. The distribution is right-skewed because
in some cases, the number of deaths increased by a thousand percent or
more in the 28 days following a rally.

Although, there were m

You can see that both median and mean are relatively close to zero.

Now, let's look at the spatial distribution of COVID-19 spread.

The red marks indicates rallies where deaths increased, the green marks
are rallies where the number of deaths decreased.

What is interesting about this figure is that there seems to be
clustering with respect to states. Consider Michigan, which is entirely
red and Pennsylvania, which is almost entirely. Now, compare with
Florida, which is almost entiredly green.

This last figure shows the percentage changes over time. There appears
to be a trend in which the number of deaths increases with time.
